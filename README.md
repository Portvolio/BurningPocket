# Burning Pocket
If you're on fire, your items randomly turn to charcoal.

NOTE: I don't think TapL ever actually gets burned in this video, so I have
to make some inferences. I'm going to infer that it's whenever a player takes
fire damage, the effect is applied. TapL says in the video that whenever a
player is burned, their items get turned to charcoal, so I'm taking that
literally and hoping that's the case. I'm also inferring out of my own
experience that lava damage counts.

## Project Notice
These are mostly being made for fun, and to prove I know what I'm doing. They
are not meant for production use, although they would probably work. These
might not always be the most efficient, but they're good enough.
